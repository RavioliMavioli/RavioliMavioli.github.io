# Welcome!
Hello!  
This is RavioliMavioli's commission and portofolio website created by using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any framework. 
  
Why did I create this from scratch? Why didn't I use Wix, Wordpress, or Carrd like any other Artists?  

Because why not.  
And I hate Wordpress.

`git clone https://github.com/RavioliMavioli/RavioliMavioli.github.io`  

Open the `index.html` to do a preview of the website.
